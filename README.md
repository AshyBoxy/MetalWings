Server sided, vanilla compatible armored elytra

Like Vanilla Tweaks' Armored Elytra, but available for 1.21

## Usage
You can combine elytra with a chestplate in an anvil, make sure you put the chestplate in the left slot. You can 
then separate them by putting them in a grindstone.

The mod works perfectly fine server only, but when on the client it'll render both the elytra and chestplate on 
players and armor stands.
